## About

In my first semester at Warsaw University of technology, I decided to learn more about data structures and algorithms.
At school, I was learning C at that time, but I found it more practical to learn two languages at one
time since I wasn't sure which path in IT am I gonna choose.

## Table of contents

- /Data structures: This folder consists of data structures written in Python. Writing them using **OOP** helped me 
to get to know both data structures and classes, methods etc.
- /Algorithms: This folder contains all algorithms I could think of. Obviously, written in Python.
